NAME
    PHPLive::Report - Generate reports for PHPLive!

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.02 of PHPLive::Report (from Perl
    distribution PHPLive-Report), released on 2014-07-24.

SYNOPSIS
    Use the included gen-phplive-reports to generate HTML report files.

DESCRIPTION
    PHP Live! is a web-based live chat/live support application,
    <http://www.phplivesupport.com/>. As of this writing, version 4.4.7, the
    reports it generates are quite limited. This module produces additional
    reports for your PHP Live! installation.

  Legends
    Report items should be obvious from their names, but here is the
    explanation:

   Chat reports
    *   pct_rated

        Percentage of chats that are rated by clients.

    *   pct_has_transfers

        Percentage of chats that involve a transfer of operators.

    *   avg_chat_duration

        Average chat duration, in minutes.

    *   avg_rating

        Average chat rating from clients. This is counted over chats that
        are rated only, of course.

    *   num_chats

        Number of chats.

    *   avg_msg_lines

        Average number of message lines in a single chat.

    *   avg_msg_words

        Average number of words in a single chat. Note that the username
        prefix in message lines and non-message lines are excluded, so in
        this snippet of transcript:

         Foo has joined the chat.
         Foo: Hello!
         Bar: How may I help you?

        the number of words is 6, not 8.

    *   avg_msg_lines

        Average number of characters in a single chat. Like in
        "avg_msg_words", the username prefix in message lines and
        non-message lines are excluded.

   Department reports
   Operator reports
FUNCTIONS
  gen_phplive_reports(%args) -> any
    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   dbh* => *obj*

    *   month* => *int*

    *   year* => *int*

    Return value:

     (any)

  parse_phplive_transcript($transcript) -> any
    The "plain" column in "p_transcripts" table stores the actual chat
    transcript. Entities characters like "<" and ">" are
    HTML-entities-escaped (becoming "&lt;" and "&gt;"). Multiple lines are
    squished together into a single line. No timestamp is recorded for each
    message.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   transcript* => *str*

    Return value:

     (any)
